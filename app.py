    #SS7 #A2P #SMS #SMPP

Hi! I'm Anton! 

I'm a telecom enthusiast interested in everything related to mobile networks, A2P (Application-to-Person) SMS and the wholesale messaging community. I'm also very passionate about data (everything from acquiring data, cleaning it and building something beautiful out of it) and learning new technologies.

Professionally I've been both technically and commercially active since 2013, working in the same broader business but for a few different companies, doing a bit of everything. I believe that having a broad understanding of how things work gives you the unique ability to see things that others might not.
